# Melissa Chen — Data Analysis Portfolio

This portfolio highlights data science and econometrics projects from my coursework at UNC Chapel Hill, including **DATA 110**, **STOR 120**, and **ECON 400**.

## 💡 Key Skills
- **Programming:** Python (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib), R (tidyverse)
- **Concepts:** Data cleaning, visualization, A/B testing, hypothesis testing, bootstrapping, regression, prediction

## 📁 Project Categories
### 1. Descriptive Analysis
Exploratory data analysis and visualization.  
*Example:* Penguin sampling and real estate price exploration.

### 2. Statistical Inference
Sampling, bootstrapping, and hypothesis testing.  
*Example:* A/B testing for treatment effects, building confidence intervals.

### 3. Regression Modeling
Simple and multiple regression to predict outcomes and interpret relationships.  
*Example:* Housing price prediction using economic and housing features.

### 4. Machine Learning
Applying basic machine learning models.  
*Example:* K-nearest neighbors and decision trees.

## 5. Group Projects
Collaborative projects completed with classmates.

**DATA 110 Final Project — Housing Price Analysis**  
Official repo: https://github.com/DylanWhitmire/Data110-Final-Project.git  

My contributions:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling missing values, selecting variables, and preparing analysis-ready dataframes)
- Regression modeling (building and interpreting multiple regression models)
- Hypothesis testing (constructing tests aligned with project questions and interpreting results)
- Visualizations (EDA plots and model/feature relationship visuals)
- Writing and interpretation (summarizing findings and explaining results clearly)
